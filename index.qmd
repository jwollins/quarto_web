Welcome to the website of Joe Collins and the Harper Adams Conservation Agriculture Systems Experiment.

## What is the website for? 

I am testing out quarto, so the website is rather sparsly populated currently. Once I have experimented with quarto and have gotten to grips with it, I hope to add the latest information on the experiment going forward here. 




## Website build info

This is a Quarto website, which I am running using the Quarto VS Code extension. 

My code can be found here:
