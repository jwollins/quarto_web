    "text": "There is increasing interest in conservation agriculture (CA) within the UK, as evidenced by the fast growth of agricultural shows such as Groundswell and the Real Oxford Farming Conference. It has been suggested that CA cannot compete with conventional practices regarding profitability. However, many scientific studies in this area only use data from a single site collected over one or two years. Evidence suggests that to identify the true effects of such the transition to CA systems, experiments need to run for longer periods and provide economic data to advise farmers properly during the transition period.\n\n\n\nBASE-UK sponsor the Harper Adams University Conservation Agriculture Systems experiment.\n\n\nAdditionally, most studies use a traditional, reductionist scientific approach, where only one variable changes during the experiment. While minimising the variables that change within an experiment may be good scientific practice and an excellent method for answering specific questions about individual mechanisms of a system, it is not well suited to evaluating large, complex systems such as agricultural systems. As such, much of the previous literature is not realistic of the real-world situation where the management requirements of agricultural systems vary considerably. For example, when a farmer transitions to CA, typically, there will be changes to the crop rotation, agronomy, and farm machinery. Therefore, assessing agricultural systems using traditional scientific methodologies can result in one, or potentially both, systems being managed in a sub-optimal way. There is a need for more systems-level agricultural research in the UK, to provide farmers with data that can help them make evidence-based business decisions.\nThis project aims to build on the PhD research of Joe Collins, who has set up a farmer-led trial to compare the overall performance of CA to conventional arable management using a systems-level field-scale experiment. It’s important to note that industry experts dictate the agronomic decisions, and local farmers and contractors conduct all field operations, highlighting the collaborative nature of this research.\nThe experiment, which has been running for 3 years and is ongoing, was set up at a 9.5 ha experimental site near Whitchurch, Shropshire (UK) on Whitegates Estate. It comprises a systematic 24 m multi-strip blocked design of CA and conventional crop production, each system is independently managed by agronomists who make all the crop management decisions based on regular field observations. This means that the agronomy, crop management and crop rotations are different between the two systems year on year. Both agronomists are competing to have the most profitable system, and therefore, all decisions are made with this in mind. The conventional system is managed by Alistair Sibbett from BCW Agriculture and the conservation system in managed by Paul Cawood from Soil First Farming. Joe Collins from Harper Adams University manages the trial and collects data on crop yield, soil, greenhouse gas emissions, and system economics.\nThe current results show that CA in the UK can reduce agronomic expenditure for farmers whilst remaining profitable. The results also highlight the importance of using a systems-level approach to CA experimentation to understand the complex system interactions and to provide useful data to farmers to aid in the transition to CA.\nBASE-UK are pleased to announce the sponsorship of the Harper Adams Conservation Agriculture Systems Experiment. Sponsorship of this experiment ensures the continuation of the project, therefore building on the existing dataset, which is useful to farmers in aiding and advising on the transition to conservation agriculture. We look forward to the future results, which Joe will be presenting at the upcoming BASE conference.\nMeet the researcher:\nJoe is a final-year PhD candidate funded by the Midlands Integrative Biosciences Training Partnership (MIBTP) and a Senior Research Associate at the Earth Rover Program. He has an MSc in Sustainable Crop Production from the University of Warwick and a BSc (Hons) in Agriculture with Crop Management from Harper Adams University. His PhD research is titled “A systems-level evaluation of Conservation Agriculture in the UK” which involves multi-disciplinary research on agronomy, soil science, economics, and greenhouse gas emissions. Joe has over ten years of experience working in the agricultural industry in the UK and abroad.\n {width=50%}"

    "text": "Firstly, I wanted to introduce myself to the BASE-UK members. Recently, an experiment I set up in Shropshire as part of my PhD has been sponsored by BASE-UK. The experiment’s premise is to evaluate Conservation Agriculture using a systems-level methodology. In layman’s terms, this means that agronomists manage the experiment, farmers conduct all the fieldwork, and therefore, the inputs and decisions are industry practice. I hope this experiment can provide BASE members and the wider farming community with data that they may find helpful for their business decisions. Watch this space, as I hope to update you regularly with any developments and talking points from the experiment. In addition, I will be presenting the experiment results at the next BASE-UK conference, so I look forward to meeting some of you in person. This newsletter will focus on my recent trip to the World Congress of Conservation Agriculture.\n\n\n\nThe poster presented at the World Congress of Conservation Agriculture in South Africa"

    "text": "02 World Congress of Conservation Agriculture\nFrom 22nd – 25th July 2024, I attended the World Congress of Conservation Agriculture held in Cape Town, South Africa to present some of my economic research from my PhD. This was the first time I had participated in this conference and the first time I had been to South Africa, so it’s fair to say I was pretty excited before the trip! As I am approaching the end of my PhD now, with only six months to go after four years of work, I wanted to present and be a part of this conference as a culmination of my PhD journey. It was a conference that I had had my eye on for some time, as I knew it would be a scientific conference with a real focus on the practical application of new agricultural technologies and methodologies, something I am particularly passionate about. A great mix of farmers, agronomists, farm advisors, and researchers (and just about every profession in between) from all over the world attend. As such, there were some fascinating talks and panel discussions during the conference about every aspect of Conservation Agriculture, from the successes to the practical, social, and political difficulties of implementing Conservation Agriculture in many farming contexts.\n\n\n\nThe tour of the Farm Research Center North of Cape Town\n\n\nBeyond the official sessions, one of the most valuable aspects of the Congress was the opportunity to network and exchange ideas with peers from across the globe. I met several farmers practising Conservation Agriculture in their respective regions. One discussion that stood out was integrating cover crops in no-till systems under different climatic conditions. I found it interesting how South African farmers adapt these practices to their unique climate, including periods of intense drought followed by sudden heavy rains. The adaptability and creativity shown by farmers in areas with challenging climates reinforced the importance of context-specific solutions in agriculture.\nWhile the Congress provided a wealth of knowledge, it also highlighted the ongoing challenges we face in promoting Conservation Agriculture. The transition from conventional farming practices is challenging, particularly in regions where policy support is lacking or where farmers face financial and technical barriers. However, the research and innovation evidenced at the congress give me hope that we can overcome these challenges together as an industry."

I’m confident that by working together and learning from global experiences, we can continue to advance Conservation Agriculture practices here at home.\nIn the coming months, I will focus on my PhD’s final stages. Still, I’m excited to keep you updated on my research progress and continue contributing to the conversation on sustainable farming. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there are particular topics you would like me to explore in future newsletters.\nThank you for your continued support, and I look forward to connecting with many of you at the next BASE-UK conference.\nJoe Collins Senior Research Associate and PhD Candidate Harper Adams University"
