The primary aim of the experiment is to aid farmers in the UK who are considering the transition to conservation agricultue, providing data on farm economics, agronomy, soil science, carbon footprinting, and greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n![](images/HAU_BASE_image.png)\n\n\n\n\n## What is the website for? \n\nI am testing out quarto, so the website is rather sparsly populated currently.
